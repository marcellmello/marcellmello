### Hi there 👋
As a Data Engineer, I specialize in Analytics Engineering, data platforms, data governance, data modeling, data quality, analytics, and machine learning. 

I hold an M.Sc. in engineering from the University of Brasilia (UnB) in Brazil, complemented by a year-long international engineering program in Spain.

Additionally, I am a researcher and Data Science enthusiast, driven by a strong passion for continuous learning. I am particularly keen on leveraging data for research related to urban mobility and bicycles.
