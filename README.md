### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an engineer from the University of Brasilia (UnB) in Brazil, with a one-year international engineering program in Spain. My experience includes data platforms, data governance, analytics, data modeling, machine learning, and data product management.

I have been working as an Analytics Engineer for a while, building a fulfilling and solid career path through data.

Additionally, I am a researcher and Data Science enthusiast, driven by a strong passion for continuous learning. I am particularly keen on leveraging data for research related to urban mobility and bicycles. Also, I am an aspiring novelist and a passionate reader. Let's talk?   ðŸ“«
