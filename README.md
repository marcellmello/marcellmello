### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a Data Engineer, I specialize in Analytics Engineering covering data platforms, data governance, data modeling, data quality, and machine learning ( AI ). 

I hold an M.Sc. in engineering from the University of Brasilia (UnB) in Brazil, complemented by a year-long international engineering program in Spain. 

Additionally, I am a researcher and Data Science enthusiast, driven by a strong passion for continuous learning and leveraging data for data-driven solutions through engineering.
